Description: # Tumblr_Terminal 
        
        Creative name, huh? Tumblr_Terminal lets you blog your frustrations from the comfort of your terminal. Check out the examples below. 
        
        ## Installation 
        
        I developed this with Python 2.7.6. If you are having trouble running it on your machine with Python 3.4+ or another version of Python, hit me up and we'll try to debug. 
        
        First, make sure you have a Tumblr account. This may or may not be a wise choice, depending on your levels of self-control. 
        
        Once you have one, you need to get login credentials. Namely, your Consumer API Key, and Consumer Secret Key. If you have them already, or might consider making an application that also utilizes the Tumblr API, follow the Direct Method. Otherwise, the API Console method would be more suitable.
        
        ### Direct Method 
        
        Go to https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps to register an application. The only information that you absolutely need to provide are the 'Application name' and 'Administrative contact email'. A 'default callback URL' is needed to register, though. If you have plans for developing a web application that utilizes the API to integrate Tumblr into, for example, your personal website so that people can post about how cool you are, then you can set this to your domain name. But if you do not care, you can either set it to '/' (without the apostrophes, of course), or 'http:127.0.0.1', where the latter option allows you to develop on your local machine. 
        
        Now that you have your Consumer and Consumer Secret keys,  
        ## Features 
        
        As of version 0.1, one can only make text posts. More features, including but not limited to posting pictures, quotes, audio and aspects such as draft and queue management are coming soon-ish. 
        
        ## Examples 
        
        To make a text post without a title: 
        `$ tumblr -t "My post"` 
        For a text post with a title: 
        `$ tumblr -tt "My post"

        The `interactive_console.py` module is a modified version of the file in Tumblr's official Python client, found here: https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr. Please read their LICENSE for more information regarding distribution and usage.
